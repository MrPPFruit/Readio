# Reader AI eval foundation

This directory contains the local schema foundation for Reader AI ordinary-reader QA evals.

Case categories:

- `person_recall`
- `object_recall`
- `event_recap`
- `relationship_recall`
- `current_recap`
- `citation_grounding`
- `spoiler_safety`

Committed eval cases must avoid raw copyrighted book text, raw prompts, answer text, API keys, local paths, book hashes, and stable private book identifiers. Store only metadata, the user-style question, expected behavior, and spoiler mode.

NotebookLM benchmark usage is manual only: compare Readio answers against NotebookLM full-book mode for the same ordinary-reader question set, then record objective metadata in `ReaderAIEvalResult`. Do not treat NotebookLM output as a CI oracle. For spoiler-protected Readio runs, evaluate only read-so-far evidence; for whole-book manual checks, record `spoilerMode: 'whole_book'` separately so results are not mixed.
